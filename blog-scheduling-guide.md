# Blog Post Scheduling Guide

## Overview

The Grass Valley Property Management Group website now includes a comprehensive blog post scheduling system that allows you to plan, organize, and automatically publish content at specific dates and times. This guide will help you understand how to use this system effectively.

## Basic Scheduling in WordPress

### Scheduling a Post for Future Publication

1. **Create or Edit a Post**: Go to Posts > Add New or edit an existing post
2. **Set Publication Date**: In the "Publish" box on the right sidebar:
   - Click "Edit" next to the date
   - Select your desired publication date and time
   - Click "OK"
3. **Save as Scheduled**: Click "Schedule" instead of "Publish"
4. **Confirm**: WordPress will confirm your post is scheduled

### Viewing Scheduled Posts

1. Go to Posts > All Posts
2. Look for the "Schedule Status" column which shows:
   - Scheduled posts with publication date and days until publication
   - Published posts marked as "Published"
   - Draft posts marked as "Draft"

## Using the Blog Schedule Calendar

We've added a custom calendar view to help you visualize your content schedule:

1. **Access the Calendar**: In the WordPress admin menu, click on "Blog Schedule"
2. **View Monthly Schedule**: The calendar shows all published and scheduled posts for the current month
3. **Identify Post Status**: 
   - Blue background: Scheduled posts
   - Green background: Published posts
   - Today's date is highlighted with a light blue background

## Managing Your Content Calendar

### Best Practices for Scheduling

1. **Consistent Publishing**: Schedule posts to publish on the same days each week (e.g., every Tuesday and Thursday)
2. **Optimal Times**: Schedule posts for times when your audience is most active (typically 9am-11am or 1pm-3pm)
3. **Content Mix**: Ensure a good mix of content types (market updates, investment tips, property management advice)
4. **Seasonal Planning**: Schedule seasonal content in advance (e.g., holiday property tips, summer maintenance guides)

### Using the Upcoming Posts Table

The "Upcoming Scheduled Posts" section below the calendar shows:
- All scheduled posts in chronological order
- Publication date and time
- Quick links to edit or preview each post

## Advanced Scheduling Tips

### Content Batching

1. **Create Multiple Posts**: Write several posts at once
2. **Schedule in Batches**: Set publication dates weeks or months apart
3. **Review Regularly**: Check your schedule weekly to ensure content remains relevant

### Editorial Calendar Integration

1. **Export Schedule**: Use the calendar view to plan your content strategy
2. **Share with Team**: Take screenshots or export data for team planning
3. **Track Performance**: Note which scheduled times perform best for future planning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Posts Not Publishing**: Ensure your server's time settings are correct
- **Schedule Not Showing**: Clear your browser cache or try a different browser
- **Missing Calendar**: Ensure you have the proper user permissions (Editor or Administrator)
